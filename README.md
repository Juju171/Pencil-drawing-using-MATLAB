## Pencil-drawing-using-MATLAB
Python implementation of the Pencil Drawing by Sketch and Tone algorithm

In this project for our Image Processing course, we will explain and implement the algorithm described in the paper: "Combining Sketch and Tone for Pencil Drawing Production" by Cewu Lu, Li Xu, Jiaya Jia

The explanations can be found in the PDF: Image_Processing_Project.pdf
